- Achieving Secure Role-Based Access Control on Encrypted Data in Cloud Storage
    --> IEEE Article: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6642048

Primary objectives for efficient and performant role based encryption (RBE)
- constant size cipher text
- constant size key when in single role
- constant size key when in multiple role
- user management delegation
- revoking user/role not affecting other user/role
- no need of reencryption after revocation

Further information:        
- RBAC - role based access control
- Role Hierarchies
- RSBAC - rule set based access control
- SARBAC model - scoped adminstrative RBAC
